## Domain of interest - Alcohol Consumption

### Interest in the field

The interest in the field arises from the recent increase in alcohol consumption, more specifically in young people. It would be appealing to research what are being the consequences of this fact in other domains such as education and health, as well as if that increase is due to facts like the economical situation or Human Development Index of the countries.

### Examples of related data driven projects

#### Project 1: [How common is alcohol and drug dependency across the world?](https://ourworldindata.org/alcohol-and-drug-dependency)

This project from the website **_Our World in Data_** presents the trends in Alcohol Consumption and Substance Use in countries all over the world, with data from 1990 to 2016. The aim is to give a better understanding of the global prevalence of substance use disorders.

Some of the conclusions in the research are:

- Across most countries, the number of alcohol use disorders is higher than other drug use disorders.
- Substance use disorders are more common among men than women.

#### [Project 2]: [SDR, selected alcohol-related causes, per 100 000](https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/indicators/hfa_293-1970-sdr-selected-alcohol-related-causes-per-100-000/)

This project carried out by the World Health Organization provide an interactive graph where we can see the age-standardized death rate per 100 000 related to alcohol. The study includes causes such as cancer of oesophagus and larynx, alcohol dependence syndrome, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis etc.

#### [Project 3]

### Data driven research questions

- **Question 1:** How is the alcohol consumption related with the economical situation a country? Does it get affected by the per capita income indicators and the development status of the countries?
- **Question 2:** Do drinking habits change in a group of students depending on some personal situation?
- **Question 3:**

## Data Sources

### Data Source 1: [Life Expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/augustus0498/life-expectancy-who)

- **Data source:** The source of this data is the Open Dataset platform Kaggle, it is public and available to use. The path of the downloaded data is: [/data/life-expectancy/](./data/life-expectancy/)
- **Data collection:** The data was collected from WHO (World Health Organization) and United Nations website with the support of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang. This dataset is a merge of the WHO dataset, which is related to life expectancy and health factors for 193 countires and the corresponding economic data collected from the United Nations website.
- **Dataset description:** The data is about how several factors such as demographic, mortality or economical can affect life expectancy. Among the observed variables some are Country, Status (developed or developing), Life Expectancy, Alcohol Consumption per capita, HIV, GDP...
- **Observations number:** The final merged dataset consists of 22 features and 2938 rows.
- **Questions that could be answered in our domain:** As our goal is to relate factors with alcohol consumption, this dataset could be very useful to associate how alcohol relates with adult mortality, GDP, years of schooling and life expectancy. For this reason this dataset could be helpful to answer the first research question.

### [Data Source 2] [Effect of Alcohol Use on GPA](https://www.kaggle.com/javidimail/effect-of-alcohol-use-on-gpa)

- **Data source:** The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school.

- **Dataset description:** It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students.
- **Observations number:** The studens math dataset has 395 observations and the student portuguese language has 649 observations. Both on them have 33 features
- **Questions that could be answered in our domain:** With this dataset we think we can undestand how drinking habits change among students based on their characteristics
